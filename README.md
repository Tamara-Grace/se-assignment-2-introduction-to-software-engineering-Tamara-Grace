Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software engineering is the systemtic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software.

Software engineering differs from traditional programming in the following ways;
Software engineering considers the entire life cycle which involves requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance unlike traditional programming which mainly focuses on the coding face giving less emphasis to the other stages.
Software engineering utilizes structured methodologies like waterfall, agile and scrum to ensure organized and efficient development while traditional programming may not follow formal methodologies often being ad-hoc and focused on quickly writing functional code.
Software engineering emphasizes on rigorous testing and quality assuarance processes to ensure the software meets specific standards and function reliably while traditional programming testing may be less formal often done by the programmer themselves without systematic quality assuarance  processes.


Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Software Development Life Cycle  consists of various phases including;
Requirements- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design- This is the phase where there is creating high-level and detailed designs of software architacture and user interface.
Implementation- This is where the codes are written and the software is built according to the design speifications.
Testing- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets the quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment- Releasing the software to users and customers.
Maintenance- Providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Comparision an Contrast;
Agile methodology is an iterative and incremental appproach with a focus of delivering working software in soft iterations while Waterfall methodology is a sequential and linear approach where each face of development is completed one after the other.
Agile methodology is highly flexible and adaptable to changes in requirements, priorities and market conditions throughout the project while Waterfall methodology is flexible as changes are difficult and expensive to implement once a phase is completed.
Agile methodology has an early and continous risk management through frequent iterations, allowing teams to identify and address risk proactively while in Waterfall methodolgy risk management may not be as emphasized until later stages of development potentially leading to unforseen issues.

Agile methodology emphasizes on continous customer collaboration and feedback throughout the development process while in Waterfall methodology customer involvement typically occurs at the beginning and the end of project with less interaction during development process.
In which scenarios might each be preferred;

Waterfall methodology may be more appropriate for projects with well-defined requirements, predictable timelines, and stable teams, while Agile methodology is better suited for projects with uncertain or evolving requirements, a need for rapid delivery, innovation, and high customer involvement.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirement engineering is the process of capturing, documenting, analyzing, and managing the requirements of a software system.

Process of requirement engineering;
Elicitation- This phase involves gathering requirements from various stakeholders, including customers, end-users, domain experts, and other relevant parties. Techniques such as interviews, workshops, surveys, and observation may be used to elicit requirements.
Analysis- Once requirements are gathered, they are analyzed to ensure they are complete, consistent, and feasible. Conflicting or ambiguous requirements are identified and resolved through discussions with stakeholders.
Specification- The requirements are documented in a clear, concise, and unambiguous manner. This may include use cases, user stories, functional and non-functional requirements, diagrams, and other artifacts to describe the desired behavior and characteristics of the software system.
Validation- The documented requirements are reviewed and validated with stakeholders to ensure they accurately reflect their needs and expectations. Any discrepancies or misunderstandings are addressed, and necessary revisions are made.
Management- Throughout the software development lifecycle, requirements are managed to track changes, prioritize requirements, and ensure traceability between requirements and other project artifacts. Requirements management tools may be used to facilitate this process.

Importance of requirement engineering in SDLC;
Customer Satisfaction- Properly elicited and documented requirements ensure that the software system meets the needs and expectations of customers and end-users, leading to higher satisfaction levels.
Reduced Development Costs- Clear and unambiguous requirements help prevent misunderstandings, rework, and scope creep, thereby reducing development costs and project delays.
Improved Communication- Requirements engineering facilitates communication and collaboration among stakeholders, ensuring that everyone has a common understanding of the project goals and requirements.
Quality Assurance- Well-defined requirements serve as a basis for designing and testing the software system. They enable developers and testers to verify that the system meets the specified requirements and behaves as expected.
Risk Management- Identifying and analyzing requirements early in the project helps identify potential risks and uncertainties, allowing project teams to mitigate risks and make informed decisions.


Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design is the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller, self-contained units or modules, each responsible for specific functionality or feature. These modules are designed to be independent, reusable, and interchangeable, with well-defined interfaces that allow them to interact with each other. The concept of modularity aims to improve the maintainability, scalability, and reusability of software systems by promoting separation of concerns and reducing complexity.

How modularity improves maintainability and scalability of software systems;
Maintainability;
Modularity makes it easier to understand, update, and maintain software systems since each module focuses on a specific aspect of functionality, developers can make changes or fix issues within a particular module without affecting other parts of the system.Maintenance efforts are localized to specific modules, reducing the risk of unintended side effects and making it easier to test and validate changes.
Scalability;
Modularity facilitates scalability by allowing software systems to be easily extended or modified to accommodate changing requirements or increased workload.New features or functionalities can be implemented by adding new modules or modifying existing ones, without the need for extensive changes to the entire system.


Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing is the testing of individuals or modules of software.
Intergration testing is the testing of interactions between components or subsystems.
System testing is the testing of entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance testing is the testing of software aganist user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Why is testimg crucial in software development;
Testing helps identify defects, errors, or bugs in the software.
Testing ensures that the software meets the specified requirements, standards, and user expectations. 
It helps prevent errors or defects from reaching production environments or end-users. 
Testing validates that the software meets the specified requirements and addresses the needs of stakeholders. 
It also helps ensure a positive user experience by identifying usability issues, accessibility barriers, or performance bottlenecks that may affect user satisfaction.
It helps mitigate risks associated with software development, deployment, and maintenance. 
Testing contributes to the maintainability of the software by identifying areas of the code that are difficult to understand, modify, or maintain.
Testing supports continuous improvement and iterative development practices by providing feedback on the software's performance and quality. 


Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version Control Systems are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members(e.g., Git, Subversion)

Why are VCS important in software development;
VCS facilitates maintaining different versions of software releases. Each release encapsulates enhancements and features developed for specific customers, aligning with the release roadmap.
By maintaining separate branches for different releases, VCS minimizes the chance of code conflicts. Changes won’t overlap, reducing the risk of conflicts during collaboration.
Beyond source code, VCS helps track changes to other artifacts (e.g., technical design specs, requirement documents). These artifacts undergo multiple iterations, and VCS ensures their history is well-documented.

Examples of popular VCS and their features;
-Git:
Git is a distributed VCS widely used in open-source and commercial projects.
Features;
Branching and Merging: Git allows creating branches for parallel development and merging them seamlessly.
Speed and Efficiency: Git’s lightweight design ensures fast operations.
Collaboration: Developers can work offline and sync changes later.
GitHub and GitLab: Platforms like GitHub and GitLab host Git repositories.
-Subversion (SVN):
SVN is a centralized VCS.
Features;
Central Repository: SVN maintains a central server where developers commit changes.
Atomic Commits: Commits are atomic, ensuring consistency.
Locking Mechanism: SVN allows exclusive locks to prevent concurrent edits.
Less Complex Branching: SVN’s branching model is simpler than Git’s.
-Mercurial:
Mercurial is another distributed VCS.
Features;
Ease of Use: Mercurial aims for simplicity and ease of adoption.
Built-in Extensions: It includes useful extensions out of the box.
Similar to Git: Mercurial shares concepts with Git but has a different command structure.


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
